## Pitch
- Based on the Design Your Life course at Stanford, this app helps you figure out which activites bring you enjoyment, energy, and engagement. These clues are the first step you need to take to design your ideal ife. The journal includes an activity log and a reflection log.
    - Activity logs record daily your main activities, and a guage to show how engaged and energized you were. 
    - Reflection logs are done once a week to record your trends, insights and suprises as to what activities work and don't work for you.
